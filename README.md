## My Attitude
I would call mine a "Understanding-based Pragmatic Approach".

Nobody can know everything about anything.
However what matter is 
- the will to discover new approaches, \
- the passion to understand deeply, \
- the desire to make things do their job, \
- the availability to re-iterate the process towards perfection (resources allowing).

I typically do not stop until my creations work and I am sure they run automatically and transparently.
