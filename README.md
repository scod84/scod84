## My Philosophy, Beliefs and Values

## My Attitude
I would call mine a "Understanding-based Pragmatic Approach".

I apply the approach of the Minimum Viable Product.

Nobody can know everything about anything.

However what matter is 
- the will to discover new approaches, 
- the passion to understand deeply, 
- the desire to make things do their job, 
- the availability to re-iterate the process towards perfection (resources allowing).

I typically do not stop until my creations work and I am sure they run automatically and transparently.
